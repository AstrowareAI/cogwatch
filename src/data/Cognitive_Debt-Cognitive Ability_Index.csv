The cognitive ability index uses 2012 as the baseline year (Index = 100). This choice is supported by multiple empirical datasets and aligns with three major inflection points in global cognitive trends.

1. Empirical peak in global test performance
OECD PISA 2012 recorded the highest international averages in mathematics and reading before consistent declines in subsequent cycles (2015, 2018, 2022).
Similarly, NAEP 2012 showed stable or peak results in U.S. reading and mathematics before decade-long erosion in scores.

; NCES NAEP 2012 Reports
).

2. First cohort reversal in the Flynn effect
Bratsberg & Rogeberg (2018, PNAS) documented the first clear reversal in national IQ trends, beginning with birth cohorts tested around 2010–2012.
This identifies 2012 as the earliest period where cognitive performance began trending downward across industrialized populations.

).

3. Transition to large-scale digital cognition
By 2012, global smartphone adoption exceeded 30 percent, and social media reached more than one billion users.
This period marked the beginning of widespread cognitive offloading—transferring reasoning, memory, and attention tasks to digital systems.
Reviews link this shift to gradual reductions in sustained attention and analytical reasoning in the following decade.

).

Summary
2012 represents the last confirmed global high point in reasoning and literacy, the onset of measurable cohort-level IQ reversals, and the start of large-scale digital cognitive reliance.
Setting the index baseline at 2012 ensures consistency across datasets and accurately reflects the transition from peak cognitive performance into the modern decline phase.
